## 📘 Project Title: SmartHR Insights – Machine Learning for Talent Management

---

### 📌 Problem Statement

Your client is a large MNC with 9 broad verticals across the organization. One of the key challenges is **identifying the right candidates for promotion** (only for manager position and below) and preparing them in advance.

The current promotion process involves:
1. Identifying employees based on recommendations and past performance.
2. Selected employees undergo training and evaluation programs tailored to each vertical.
3. Promotions are granted based on training performance, KPI completion (only those with >60% KPI), etc.

However, this evaluation process causes delays in transitioning employees into new roles. The company needs a **predictive solution** to identify eligible candidates earlier in the cycle, using historical data that includes performance and demographic attributes.

Your task is to build a **classification model** that can predict whether a potential promotee in the test set will be promoted or not, thus helping the company **streamline and expedite** the promotion process.

### 🎯 Objective of the Project

To build an efficient and accurate machine learning model that predicts whether an employee will be promoted based on various HR-related features, ultimately assisting the HR department in making faster and fairer promotion decisions.

---

### ✅ Key Goals of the Model

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on HR data.
- Explore and visualize key variables influencing promotions.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
- Build a classification model (Random Forest Classifier).
- Use 70% training and 30% testing data split (`random_state=10`).
- Evaluate the model using F1 Score due to class imbalance.
- Apply the trained model on test data to predict final outcomes.

---

### 🧠 Key Features Used

Some of the important features observed during analysis:

- **No. of Trainings**
- **Previous Year Rating**
- **Length of Service**
- **KPIs Met > 80%**
- **Awards Won**
- **Average Training Score**
- **Education Level**
- **Department & Region**
- **Gender & Recruitment Channel**

---

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook contains detailed observations from EDA including:

- Countplots and boxplots for categorical vs target variables
- Distribution of promotion status across departments
- Correlation matrix and heatmaps
- Impact of training score and service length on promotion

(Notebook shows 15+ detailed insights from the dataset.)

### 🤖 Machine Learning Approach

- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Data Split**: 70% Train / 30% Test
- **Evaluation Metric**: F1 Score (best for imbalanced classes)
- **Target Variable**: `is_promoted` (0/1)

---

### 💼 Business Impact

- **Accelerated Promotion Pipeline**: Speeds up identification of eligible employees.
- **Bias Reduction**: Promotes fair decision-making based on data, not intuition.
- **Improved Employee Retention**: Timely recognition and reward increase morale.
- **Scalability**: Can be adapted to different verticals or updated with new data.

---

### 🧾 Conclusion

This model empowers HR teams to take data-driven decisions for promotions by identifying top performers early. By leveraging demographic, performance, and training features, the solution improves overall efficiency and fairness in the promotion cycle.

Continuous tuning and retraining with new datasets will further increase the robustness of the model.
